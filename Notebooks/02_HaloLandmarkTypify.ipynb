Here, we store and organise the halo in a sparse format. The output `{pdbid}.halotup` is a tuple containing 4 items `halo_tuple = (halo_index, lattice_shape, lattice_minmax, halo_bound)`:\n",

    "We use the term 'Landmarks' to generalise on a collection of coordinates corresponding to certain classes.

In some cases, we may want to remove internally redundant landmarks (i.e. those coming from copies of the same/almost-exact-matched nucleotide chain) and keep only a non-redundant copy (marked with a suffix `_`), so that a fair efficient validation dataset can be constructed. In the current implementation, a simple edit distance is used to recognise matching nucleotide chains in a PDB entry. We will illustrate this in next cell. \n",

    "A parameter worth mentioning is `AtomicContactDistanceThreshold = 3.8`. This defines how far heavy atoms of nucleotide components can be away from any protein heavy atoms when we consider it as a valid landmark interacting with the protein. 3.8 Å is the [nominal max distance](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12539-015-0263-z#Fig1) concerning face-to-face $\\pi \\pi$ stacking. Setting `AtomicContactDistanceThreshold = 3.8` means when there is no protein heavy atom within 3.8 Å of the nucleotide component, then the nucleotide component will not be considered as a valid landmark. The output `.nucsite.landmark` is a biopandas format dataframe containing an extra column `ProteinAtomContactNumber` to indicate how many atoms are within `AtomicContactDistanceThreshold`; invalid landmarks are will have `ProteinAtomContactNumber == 0`. (Note rather than deleting the landmark we will still keep it; this is necessary because these \"placeholders\" will keep the voronoi boundary clean in later steps). We will use this parameter to remove non-interacting components.\n",

This copy is chosen as the one making most contact with proteins. Also note that many of the \"copies\" are not exact-matches - some positions in these asymmetric units are truncated or missing such that we need to tolerate their similarities with [edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance). Note that we should never remove a homologous unit (protein/nucleotide) when we later on featurise a site, because that will remove the interfacing features - we should simply indicate them by landmarks.\n",

    "Similar problems concerning redundance exist among subsets of separate PDB entries with homologous sequences; we will handle this External Symmetry in the training stage by reweighed sampling of clans."

    "* Assignment to the Nearest Landmark Centroid with flag `TakeCentroid = True`. This assign each voxel in the halo to take the same class as the nearest landmark. This is equivalent to a Voronoi tessellation process, but we can avoid assigning voxels to nearest landmark too far away by the flag `DistanceCutoff = 3.0`, here the 3.0 angstrom is chosen such that a sphere centered at the centroid with this radius will contain all atoms in a component of nucleotide.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Assignment of Non-sites. These are voxels in the halo that is not within any nucleotide or designated resname. We also considered the redundance in these voxels due to the Internal Symmetry in the PDB entry. There are usually much more non-sites than sites; there are usually much more redundant non-sites than non-redundant ones. So, a natural sparse annotation is to indicate all not-non-sites as 1 in a column (not-non-site versus its complement, which is non-site) and all non-redundant non-site as 1 in another column (non-redundant non-site vs its complement, which can be redundant non-site or not-nonsite). \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the following 13 classes including indication of places of absence `nonsite_` are provided. \n",

It will produce a sparse class matrix (n_halovoxels, n_classes) that correspond to the halo's voxel index tuples (n_halovoxels, 3) with columns indicating the class assigned. Non-redundancy is indicated by class with a suffix underscore. \n",

    "\n",
    "* D/RNA Hybrids are handled by class labels `(A,G,C,T,U,\"D\",\"R\",P)` in `*.nucsite.landmark`. `\"D\"` and `\"R\"` are deoxy-ribose and ribose respectively; overlapping base `A,G,C` in D/RNA are merged. Note that some NA-binding proteins can accept both D/RNA sharing the same base disregarding the difference in ribose. Also note that this same indifference pertains in the classification of bases. A critique here is that while classification among base, phosphate, ribose and nonsite is largely multi-class-single-label, the classification of AUCG can be multi-class-multi-label, though a nice pareto is achieved in our model due to variance in data label.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Currently the matrix contains only 1 or 0 (though I store it as a float!) but certainly when sequence-based ground truth are incorporated we can take the probability. Note that we should also make effort to take covariance in sequence in account e.g. calculating a (n_lenseq,n_lenseq,4,4) covariance tensor. We will need to think about how to realise this data format. \n"

    "In the first implementation of NucleicNet, all calculations were done on voxels from a regular cubic lattice and, as a pilot study, we did not implement data structure that allows communication among voxels, because that will require data augmentation to remedy the lifting of rotational/permutation invariance. Here, we do something more by giving the indices of the halo; this allow fast search of neighboring halos on a kDTree. Some directions:\n",
    "* Coordinates. Rather than storing as indices (integers), we also stored coordinate (floats) of halo as `.haloxyz`. Both the indices and coordinates will work on a kDTree to catch neighboring voxels. The plus here for storing the coordinate is that it will facillitate development of collecting features on mesh (rather than regular lattice). The mesh can be an isosurface triangulation or some other level set. But note that a simple [Marching Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) isosurface is not necessarily translational invariant.\n",
    "* Pocket Landmarks. Currently, the time profile bottleneck is on the use of Fpocket. Maybe we should implement a light-weight [alpha sphere algorithm](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs268-11-spring/handouts/AlphaShapes/as_fisher.pdf) to simplify the process. \n",
    "* Bounds of Halo. While a lower bound at 2.5 angstrom make perfect sense in ML models with no message passing among voxels as reasoned above, when the restriction on message passing is lifted, those voxels between 1.25 and 2.5 angstrom with lower sparsity in the feature vector may provide more textured information to those voxels further away.
